RCP Download Monitor Bridge
===========================

Limit [Download Monitor](http://wordpress.org/plugins/download-monitor/) file downloads to active members in [Restrict Content Pro](https://restrictcontentpro.com/).

This extension adds the "restrict this content" meta box to the "Edit Download" interface in Download Monitor. This allows you to restrict the download to members only.

If a file is not restricted it will not require an active membership.
